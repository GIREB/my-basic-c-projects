//This code is written for the usage of macros in C programming language
//This code includes the usage of macros for finding the biggest number, smallest number, time, sum of numbers, difference of numbers, multiplication of numbers, division of numbers, mod of numbers, square of numbers, and checking if the entered value is a number or a character.

//The macros are defined in the following lines
#define biggestnumber(a,b) (a>b)?a:b
#define smallestnumber(a,b) (a<b)?a:b
#define saytime(withletter)(withletter==T||withletter==t)?__TIME__:"You dont want to know the time"
#define plusnumber(a,b) a+b
#define minusnumber(a,b) a-b
#define multiplynumber(a,b) a*b
#define dividenumbers(a,b) a/b
#define modnumber(a,b) a%b
#define squarenumber(a) a*a
#define numberorcharacter(a1) (a1>=48&&a1<=57)?"This is a number":"This is a character"
